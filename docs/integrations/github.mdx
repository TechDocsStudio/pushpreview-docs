# Pull request previews for GitHub

Integrating PushPreview with GitHub empowers efficient collaboration and code quality through automated preview generation directly within your workflow. This documentation details the installation, authentication, and configuration specifics of PushPreview integration with GitHub.

## Quickstart

Enable pull request previews on GitHub with PushPreview by following the [Quickstart](/quickstart.md). 

This step-by-step guide explains how to integrate automated preview generation into your GitHub workflow, streamlining review processes for web projects and applications

## Authentication

Previews generated through PushPreview are public by default. However, for added security or confidentiality, PushPreview offers private previews. For more information, see [Private previews](/configuration/private-previews.md).

When accessing a private preview, PushPreview prompts for a GitHub login to ensure secure access:

![GitHub enable](../images/auth-github.png)

Only users with permission to see the repository can access the preview.

PushPreview uses OAuth 2.0 authentication to maintain a secure connection with GitHub.

## GitHub Action

The [TechDocsStudio/pushpreview-action](https://github.com/TechDocsStudio/pushpreview-action) facilitates the connection between GitHub and PushPreview, integrating it into your GitHub workflow.

Below is an example of how to use the `push-preview-action` in a workflow:

```yaml
name: PushPreview
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types:
      - labeled
jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event.label.name == 'preview'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
      - name: Comment
        run: |
          gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "⚙️ Hang tight! PushPreview is currently building your preview. We'll share the URL as soon as it's ready."
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - name: Set BASE_URL
        run: echo "BASE_URL=/github/${{ github.repository }}/${{ github.event.number }}/" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - name: Build site
        run: |
          cd docs
          yarn install --frozen-lockfile
          yarn build
      - name: Generate preview
        uses: TechDocsStudio/pushpreview-action@1.0.6
        with:
          source-directory: ./docs/build
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          pushpreview-token: ${{ secrets.PUSHPREVIEW_TOKEN }}
```
