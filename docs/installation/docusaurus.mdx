# Pull request previews for Docusaurus

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you install PushPreview in your Docusaurus project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to have the following:

- A PushPreview account. If you don't have one, [sign up for free](https://app.pushpreview.com/accounts/signup/).
- A Docusaurus site created.

## 1. Add the workflow to your repository

To set up the PushPreview workflow in your Docusaurus project:

1. Go to the `.github/workflows` directory in your Docusaurus repository.

1. Create a new file named `pushpreview.yml`.

1. Copy the following content into `pushpreview.yml`:

    ```yaml
    name: PushPreview

    on:
      pull_request_target:
        types:
          - labeled

    jobs:
      preview:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        if: github.event.label.name == 'preview'
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4
            with:
              ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
          - name: Comment
            run: |
              gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "⚙️ Hang tight! PushPreview is currently building your preview. We'll share the URL as soon as it's ready."
            env:
              GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

          - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
            with:
              node-version: 18

          - name: Set BASE_URL
            run: echo "BASE_URL=/github/${{ github.repository }}/${{ github.event.number }}/" >> $GITHUB_ENV

          - name: Build site
            run: |
              cd docs
              yarn install --frozen-lockfile
              yarn build

          - name: Generate preview
            uses: TechDocsStudio/pushpreview-action@1.0.6
            with:
              source-directory: ./docs/build
              github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
              pushpreview-token: ${{ secrets.PUSHPREVIEW_TOKEN }}
    ```

1. Modify the **Build site step** to align with your Docusaurus build process. For example:

    ```yaml
    - name: Build site
      run: |
        cd docs
        yarn install --frozen-lockfile
        yarn build
    ```
    
1. Ensure the `source-directory` in the **Generate preview** step points to your Docusaurus build output folder, typically `./build`:

    ```yaml
    - name: Generate preview
      uses: TechDocsStudio/pushpreview-action@1.0.6
      with:
        # highlight-next-line
        source-directory: ./docs/build
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        pushpreview-token: ${{ secrets.PUSHPREVIEW_TOKEN }}
    ```

1. Save your changes and push the updated `pushpreview.yml` file to your repository.

## 2. Configure the GitHub secret

<GitHubSecret />

## 3. Edit Docusaurus configuration

To ensure your Docusaurus site correctly supports preview builds, you'll need to adjust the base URL setting in the Docusaurus configuration.
This modification allows your site to correctly resolve URLs in the context of the preview environment.
Follow the steps below to make these changes:

1. Open the `docusaurus.config.js` file located in the root directory of your Docusaurus project.

1. Modify the `baseUrl` setting to dynamically adapt to different environments, particularly for preview deployments. Update the setting as follows:

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    // ... other configurations ...
    baseUrl: process.env.BASE_URL || '/',
    // ... other configurations ...
  };
  ```

3. Save the changes and push the updated `docusaurus.config.js` file to your repository to enable correct URL handling in preview builds.

## 4. Verify the installation
