# Pull request previews for Sphinx

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you install PushPreview in your Sphinx project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to have the following:

- A PushPreview account. If you don't have one, [sign up for free](https://app.pushpreview.com/accounts/signup/).
- A Sphinx site created.

## 1. Add the workflow to your repository

To set up the PushPreview workflow in your Sphinx project:

1. Go to the `.github/workflows` directory in your Sphinx repository.

1. Create a new file named `pushpreview.yml`.

1. Copy the following content into `pushpreview.yml`:

    ```yaml
    name: PushPreview

    on:
      pull_request_target:
        types:
          - labeled

    jobs:
      preview:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        if: github.event.label.name == 'preview'
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - name: Comment
            run: |
              gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "⚙️ Hang tight! PushPreview is currently building your preview. We'll share the URL as soon as it's ready."
            env:
              GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

          - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
            with:
              node-version: 18

          - name: Set BASE_URL
            run: echo "BASE_URL=/github/${{ github.repository }}/${{ github.event.number }}/" >> $GITHUB_ENV

          - name: Build site
            run: |
              cd docs
              yarn install --frozen-lockfile
              yarn build

          - name: Generate preview
            uses: PushLabsHQ/pushpreview-action@1.0.6
            with:
              source-directory: ./docs/build
              github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
              pushpreview-token: ${{ secrets.PUSHPREVIEW_TOKEN }}
    ```

1. Replace the `actions/setup-node@v3` step to install Python instead:

    ```yaml
    - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8  # Adjust the Python version as needed for your project
    ```

1. Modify the **Build site step** to align with your Sphinx build process. For example:

    ```yaml
    - name: Build site
      run: |
        cd docs
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        sphinx-build -b html source _build/html
    ```
    
1. Ensure the `source-directory` in the **Generate preview** step points to your Sphinx build output folder, typically `./_build/html`:

    ```yaml
    - name: Generate preview
      uses: PushLabsHQ/pushpreview-action@1.0.6
      with:
        # highlight-next-line
        source-directory: ./docs/_build/html
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        pushpreview-token: ${{ secrets.PUSHPREVIEW_TOKEN }}
    ```

## 2. Configure the GitHub secret

<GitHubSecret />

## 3. Edit Sphinx configuration

To ensure your Sphinx site correctly supports preview builds, you'll need to adjust the base URL setting in the Sphinx configuration.
This modification allows your site to correctly resolve URLs in the context of the preview environment.

Follow the steps below to make these changes:

1. Open the `conf.py` file located in the root directory of your Sphinx project.

1. Modify the `base_url` setting to dynamically adapt to different environments, particularly for preview deployments. Update the setting as follows:

    ```python
    import os
    html_baseurl = os.getenv('BASE_URL', 'https://yourdomain.extension')
    ```

1. Save your changes and push the updated `pushpreview.yml` file to your repository.

## 4. Verify the installation

<VerifyInstallation />
