# Pull request previews for Jekyll

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you install PushPreview in your Jekyll project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to have the following:

- A PushPreview account. If you don't have one, [sign up for free](https://app.pushpreview.com/accounts/signup/).
- A Jekyll site created.

## 1. Add the workflow to your repository

To set up the PushPreview workflow in your Jekyll project:

1. Go to the `.github/workflows` directory in your Jekyll repository.

1. Create a new file named `pushpreview.yml`.

1. Copy the following content into `pushpreview.yml`:

    ```yaml
    name: PushPreview

    on:
      pull_request_target:
        types:
          - labeled

    jobs:
      preview:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        if: github.event.label.name == 'preview'
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - name: Comment
            run: |
              gh pr comment ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --repo ${{ github.repository }} --body "⚙️ Hang tight! PushPreview is currently building your preview. We'll share the URL as soon as it's ready."
            env:
              GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

          - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
            with:
              node-version: 18

          - name: Set BASE_URL
            run: echo "BASE_URL=/github/${{ github.repository }}/${{ github.event.number }}/" >> $GITHUB_ENV

          - name: Build site
            run: |
              cd docs
              yarn install --frozen-lockfile
              yarn build

          - name: Generate preview
            uses: TechDocsStudio/pushpreview-action@1.0.6
            with:
              source-directory: ./docs/build
              github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
              pushpreview-token: ${{ secrets.PUSHPREVIEW_TOKEN }}
    ```

1. Replace the `actions/setup-node@v3` step to install Ruby instead:

    ```yaml
    - name: Setup Ruby
      uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
      with:
        ruby-version: '3.0' # Adjust the Ruby version as needed for your project
    ```

1. Modify the **Build site step** to align with your Jekyll build process. For example:

    ```yaml
    - name: Build site
      run: |
        cd docs
        gem install bundler
        bundle install
        bundle exec jekyll build
    ```
    
1. Ensure the `source-directory` in the **Generate preview** step points to your Jekyll build output folder, typically `./_site`:

    ```yaml
    - name: Generate preview
      uses: TechDocsStudio/pushpreview-action@1.0.6
      with:
        # highlight-next-line
        source-directory: ./docs/_site
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        pushpreview-token: ${{ secrets.PUSHPREVIEW_TOKEN }}
    ```

1. Save your changes and push the updated `pushpreview.yml` file to your repository.

## 2. Configure the GitHub secret

<GitHubSecret />

## 3. Verify the installation

<VerifyInstallation />
